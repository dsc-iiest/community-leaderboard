# Contributing to community-leaderboard

Thank you for taking the time to contribute. As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

1. Start working on an issue you’re assigned to. If you’re not assigned to any issue, find the issue with the highest priority you can work on, by relevant label and assign it to yourself. Priority is given by milestones. You should always check issues in the current milestone, then short-term, middle-term and long-term in that order.
2. You are responsible for the issue that you're assigned to. If you are not able to do it or you believe you won't make it, report it to the maintainer.


## Creating a Pull Request
Add following prefixes to the PR to help the maintainers

- [NEW] for new features 
- [FIX] for bug fixes. You should include the issue number(s) in parenthesis, whenever possible.
